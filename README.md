# Lesson_5-BlockBraker

Block Braker is one of many games, where player needs to destroy all of the blocks, with a ball,
without causing that ball to fall.

- There are only two levels, where I was testing different types of blocks. 
- Blocks are prefabs, so there is an easy way to creare another stages.
- Basic MainMenu and EndGame Scenes, contains only a text and button.
- First game with implemented sound.
